How does it work over there?
============================

1/ MainPage uses MainViewModel as viewmodel
This MainPage.xaml contains a Pivot control with several PivotItems
A PivotItem for a list of other pages reachable from this MainPage
	Property "OtherPages" of type ContentsViewModel is list of other pages reachable from this page
	It is shown in a PivotItem on the MainPage.xaml bound to the property OtherPages
	Inside this PivotItem is a ListBox bound to the property Contents of ContentsViewModel
A PivotItem for the profile of the user


2/ ArticlesPage uses ContainerViewModel derived classes, nl. ForumsViewModel and ArticlesViewModel
This ArticlesPage.xaml contains a Pivot with no explicite PivotItems
The Pivot control 
	ItemsSource is bound to the ContainerViewModel class Items property which is a collection of 
		CPViewModel derived objects. The first one in the collection is a ContentsViewModel object
		with all the pages which can be reached from this page, the others are RssFeedViewModel
		instances, each representing an RSS feed
	ItemTemplate is bound to the StaticResource DynamicContentTemplate
	This static resource then creates a ContentControl bound to the ItemDataTemplate property of its data, which
	is the ItemDataTemplate property of the CPViewModel derived object
		<DataTemplate x:Key="DynamicContentTemplate">
			<ContentControl Content="{Binding .}" VerticalContentAlignment="Stretch" HorizontalContentAlignment="Stretch" ContentTemplate="{Binding Path=ItemDataTemplate}" />
		</DataTemplate>
	In case of ContentsViewModel, this is App.Current.Resources["ContentsTemplate"] as DataTemplate
	In case of RssFeedViewModel, this is App.Current.Resources["RssFeedTemplate"] as DataTemplate
